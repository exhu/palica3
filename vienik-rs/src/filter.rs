// TODO implement filtering logic
// - source item is the file path
// - filter item either matches, or not
// - filter item has either include or exclude action
// - initial source item include state = false
// - if matches and include -> include source item (override previous state)
// - if matches and exclude -> exclude source item (override previous state)
// - if not matches -> keep previous state
// - after all the chain of filters is parsed, final decision is made
