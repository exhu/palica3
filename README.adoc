Usable command line tool, and optionally gui. Collects all files, but
primary usage is for image and video files on removable storage.

== TODO
* collection
** add, warn if there're collections with the same source path
** sync, warn if there're collections with the same source path
** remove
** add file, dir, files from list, ignore hidden files/folders ".*"
** support media detection for collections from the same source path, e.g. for /cdrom
via fs uuid (e.g. blkid)

* metadata database
** name
** tags (keywords)
** date
** size
** mime-type
** sha256

* sync report
** collection availability
** directory existence
** file existence
** changes:
*** file date
*** file sha256
*** file type


* rich filtering (tags, date, mime) options
* if necessary replace dynamic arrays with ranges for collections, tags, dirs etc.
* parallel processing

== DONE
* scan directory tree, build collection
* basic db operations (collection, direntry objects)
* basic fs operations (directory entry info)
* replace direct sqlite3 calls with d2sqlite3
* make a better cli and usage screen (parse args based on command)

== Dependencies

* sqlite library (libsqlite3-dev)

* any image viewer, e.g. feh or gwenview
