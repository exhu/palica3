= Photo/video collection management tools
(C) 2023 Yury Benesh

== Overview
Distributed under GPLv3+ without any warranty, see link:COPYING[].

Usable command line tool, and optionally gui. Collects all files, but
primary usage is for image and video files on removable storage.

.Programs
* palica-rs -- database management tools
* vienik-rs -- file management tools

== TODO
* collection
** implement sync
** don't allow to delete patterns used in a filter
** don't allow to delete filters used by collections
** sync, warn if there're collections with the same source path
** support media detection for collections from the same source path, e.g. for /cdrom
via fs uuid (e.g. blkid)
** add colouring
** add file, dir, files from list, ignore hidden files/folders ".*"

* metadata database
** tags (keywords)
** mime-type
** sha256

* sync report
** collection availability
** directory existence
** file existence
** changes:
*** file date
*** file sha256
*** file type


* rich filtering (tags, date, mime) options
* if necessary replace dynamic arrays with ranges for collections, tags, dirs etc.
* parallel processing

== DONE
* collection
** tree? (may be there's a linux command to format file list as tree)
** remove
*** file
*** dir
*** collection
** use filter when populating/sync collection
** file list (all files of a collection)
** save filter name for collection
** add, warn if there're collections with the same source path
* scan directory tree, build collection
* basic db operations (collection, direntry objects)
* basic fs operations (directory entry info)
* make a better cli and usage screen (parse args based on command)
* metadata database
** name
** date
** size

== Dependencies

* exiftool command line utility

* sqlite library (libsqlite3-dev)

* any image viewer, e.g. feh or gwenview

== Versions Planning
=== MVP
* Collections management
** Add
*** Using glob (file path) filter
** Remove
** Sync filesystem
*** Ask if deleted files are really deleted or there's fs mismatch
** Tags from xmp
* Select files (print file list)
** by path (collection:/path)
** by path filter
** by tags
*** if contains any of the selected tags
*** if contains no tags

=== Version 1
* Normalize program output
** all diagnostic/debug messages to stderr
** output must be parseable
* Path filter editing
* Generate xmp by exiftool
* File hash
* Tag add, remove, update xmp with exiftool
* File rename, delete, move commands

=== Version 2
* Thumbnails
* Perceptual hash https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_hashing
* For video files https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#signature-1
* Device id

=== Version N
* Use file hash to detect moves, renames
* Thumbnails browser

=== Version N+1
* Mime types
